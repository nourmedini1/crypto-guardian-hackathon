## Problem Statement

The cryptocurrency space is heavily targeted by scams such as pump-and-dump schemes, rug pulls, and misinformation campaigns, especially on platforms like Telegram. These tactics often go unnoticed until after major financial losses occur.

**Objective:**  
Build a comprehensive AI assistant capable of detecting scams, analyzing sentiment, predicting price trends, and answering user questions using reliable crypto knowledge‚Äîdelivered in real time via web and Telegram.

---

##  Solution Overview

Crypto Guardian combines several intelligent components to form an integrated assistant that addresses multiple facets of crypto security.

### ‚ú≥ Key Features

- **LLM-Based Sentiment Analysis**  
  Analyzes message streams in Telegram groups to detect sentiment shifts indicative of pump-and-dump schemes. Uses prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs) for nuanced emotion and manipulation detection.

- **RAG Chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
  Provides context-grounded answers to user questions by retrieving relevant information from a curated crypto knowledge base and generating responses using an LLM.

- **Telegram Bot Integration**  
  Allows users to interact with the assistant directly via Telegram. It not only answers questions but also sends scam alerts when manipulation or suspicious group activity is detected.

- **Voice-Enabled Web Assistant**  
  Enables users to talk with the assistant using Speech-to-Text (STT) and receive spoken replies through Text-to-Speech (TTS), improving accessibility and ease of use.

- **Ethereum Price Prediction**  
  Forecasts ETH prices using an LSTM-based time series prediction model. Helps users understand market trends over a 7-day horizon.

- **Rug Pull Detection System**  
  Scans and analyzes token behavior using smart contract metadata and liquidity movement patterns to identify potential rug pulls. Flags suspicious tokens exhibiting signs of exit scams or sudden fund drainage.

##  System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with React for an interactive web UI displaying live crypto data and supporting chatbot interaction.
- **Backend**: Python-based services using FastAPI for model inference, sentiment analysis, and RAG logic.
- **AI Layer**: LLMs for sentiment analysis and chatbot logic, LSTM for price forecasting.
- **Bots**: Telegram integration via Telethon and Telegram Bot API for real-time user interaction and alerting.
- **Voice Interface**: Web Speech API enables seamless spoken input and output.
